ðŸ”§ Codespace container:

    This codespace launches into a development environment managed by
    Miniconda. It contains the Conda environment 'trv-dev' set up by
    `micromamba` with all build, runtime and test dependencies installed
    from the 'conda-forge' channel. The VS Code editor is pre-configured
    with extensions for C++/Python/Cython development and documentation.

To build a developmental version of the project code, run the following
in the terminal:

    micromamba activate trv-dev
    make clean
    make -j -O install useomp=true

This will produce the binary executable at build/bin/triumvirate and
install an editable version of the Python package.

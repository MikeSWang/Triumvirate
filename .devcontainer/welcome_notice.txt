ðŸ”§ Development environment:

    This codespace container is managed by Miniconda. It contains the
    Conda environment 'trv-dev' set up by `micromamba` with all build,
    runtime and test dependencies installed from the 'conda-forge'
    channel. The VS Code editor is pre-configured with extensions for
    C++/Python/Cython development and documentation.

To start your development, activate the pre-configured environment:

    $ micromamba activate trv-dev

To build the project, execute:

    $ make clean && make -j -O install useomp=true

This will produce the binary executable at build/bin/triumvirate and
install an editable version of the Python package.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability privately on GitHub via the repository's
[security section](https://github.com/MikeSWang/Triumvirate/security).

We will respond as soon as possible if a vulnerability is admitted, and
provide a security update as a matter of priority. The exact timing depends
on the available resources and the severity of the vulnerability.

If a vulnerability report is dismissed, we will take no further action
but you may [open a public GitHub issue](https://github.com/MikeSWang/Triumvirate/issues/new/choose).

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

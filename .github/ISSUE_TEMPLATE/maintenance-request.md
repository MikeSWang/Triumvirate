## Is the maintenance request a bug report or feature suggestion?

Maintenance is carried out to deal with non-critical issues that
do not alter the API of public releases. Examples include internal syntax
changes and typo corrections in comments.

If your issue is critical (e.g. crashes, incorrect results), please
send a bug report. If your issue relates to a feature extension, please
make a feature suggestion instead.

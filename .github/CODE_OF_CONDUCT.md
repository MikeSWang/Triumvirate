## Repository policy

Translation by Mitchell (1988):

> Throw away morality and justice, and people will do the right thing.

&emsp;&mdash; _Dao De Jing_, ยง19

> When the Tao is lost, there is goodness.
> When goodness is lost, there is morality.
> When morality is lost, there is ritual.
> Ritual is the husk of true faith, the beginning of chaos.

&emsp;&mdash; _Dao De Jing_, ยง38

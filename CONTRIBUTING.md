User feedback and contributions are highly valued and very welcome. If
you have found an issue, please refer to '[Reporting issues](#issue)';
if you would like to contribute, please refer to
'[Contributing](#contribution)'.


## <a name="issue"></a> Reporting issues

Before reporting a new issue, please check it has not already been reported
in [Issues](https://github.com/MikeSWang/Triumvirate/issues).

If so, [open a new issue](https://github.com/MikeSWang/Triumvirate/issues/new)
with a title and description including any relevant information. If possible,
show a minimum (non-)working example as well as expected code behaviour.

If the issue relates to build/installation, please also include the
information about your OS environment.


## <a name="contribution"></a> Contributing

To make a contribution such as a bug fix or a feature, please fork
``Triumvirate`` into your GitHub repositories and clone it to your local
machine. Always create a new branch for your edits and once complete,
commit and push it to your forked repository. Finally, open a pull
request.

If ``Triumvirate`` has been updated while you are editing your forked copy,
please merge the updated ``main`` branch first before completing your edits.

Please ensure your edits conform to [PEP-8](
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standards as closely as possible,
and always include doc-strings (ideally in the [``numpydoc``](
https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) format) and unit tests
if you are adding new features.
